## Business understanding
Datacenters and Supercomputers have to distribute a huge pool of hardware resources efficiently across users and applications. The utilization of those resources can vary significantly depending on various factors such as the workload and time of day. Being able to accurately predict the demand for hardware resources in the future is very important tonsure uninterrupted operation. Recently, Machine Learning methods have been used to learn the utilization of the systems resources and predict future demand. Methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks are great at forecasting the numerical values of utilization. This project will explore the coupling of Computer Vision methods together with Machine Learning for the purpose of predicting system resource utilization. In more detail, the project will compare the achieved prediction accuracy of training machine learning models over numerical data vs. their image representations. The use of images has shown to have great potential to reduce training times and achieve higher prediction accuracy in other domains, such as in finance and the stock market.
